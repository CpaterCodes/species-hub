# Species Hub

## Rationale

A react frontend interface intended to consume and present data regarding
various species. 
Intending to revisit React via Typescript following a year
of work with React Native and Typescript, I have decided to revisit my
enthusiasm for the natural world and put together an interface for the 
retrieval and presentation of information about species.

## Feature Specs 

```
As a User
To find animals of interest
I wish to be suggested animal names when searching
[Working (not pretty) UI; API call logic to come]
```

```
As a User
So I may bring up information about an animal
I wish to be able to commit a search and bring this animal up
[Todo]
```
